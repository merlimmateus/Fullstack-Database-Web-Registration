# dataBaseWebAuthRegistration

This is a spring-boot-web project integrated with postgresql database. For the front-end it was used VueJs framework.

I made this project initially for personal knowlodge, but i introduce this project for my database web teacher at university and this integration of back-end with the datavase it was used as a example for all class. I made in the future a video as a tutorial about how it was made the backend and integration with database
